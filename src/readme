A weblog aggregator ping proxy
by Keith Gaughan


Background
----------

While sitting in a Boston hotel room one weekend, filled to the gills with some
noxious disease I picked up either on the plane the weekend before or in the
office later that week, I found myself in need of something to do. Heading out
was out of the question, and American TV is, well, rubbish. It was a matter of
either doing something productive or going daft.

So I wrote a weblog ping proxy.


Usage
-----

The code's simple enough to edit. It's divided up into sections, and the bits
of most interest to you are the ones marked 'Configuration and Ping Responders'
and 'Page Template'. You edit the former to add and remove ping responders and
other settings, and the latter to reskin BlogPing to your own taste.

As of 1.6, BlogPing has an interface more suitable for programmatic use. The
interface is a POST request identical to the normal POST request from the
BlogPing form, but with the presence of the `quiet` parameter. The response
status will either be a 400 (Bad Request) and the body will be diagnostics, one
per line, or a list of responses, one per line, from each of the XML-RPC
responders pinged. Each response contains three fields, each separated by TAB
characters. The first field indicates success or failure, indicated by `+` and
`-` respectively. The second field contains the name of the service pinged.
The third field contains the message sent back by the responder. The content
type of the response will be `text/plain` in both cases and within the fields,
TAB characters as escaped with `\t`, and newlines/linefeeds with `\n`.


Technical Details
-----------------

You'll need PHP obviously. It works just fine on PHP 5 (which I have on my
laptop) and PHP 4 (which the server hosting the copy on my site runs). A quick
scan through the PHP manual lets me know that PHP 4.1 is the minimum you'll
need, though I'm only comfortable recommending a minimum of PHP 4.3.

It doesn't depend on any PECL modules or modules which might not be enabled
with your hosting provider such as cURL, so it should be deployable everywhere,
but you're out of luck if your hosting provider doesn't allow the opening of
sockets. It doesn't care about your magic quotes settings, but turn them off
anyway if you can because it's a retarded misfeature.

The HTTP client code is pretty robust and designed to work with even the most
slow and petulant aggregators (*cough* PlanetPHP *cough*), but it doesn't
understand the chunked transfer encoding, so be warned. Also the code for
inspecting the response cheats somewhat. Rather than digging through the
document, we just look for `flerror` and `message` and extract the values
following them. Simple, but effective.


Flaws/Bugs
----------

BlogPing's primary flaw, which is primarily due to the fact that it's
implemented in PHP, is that it does not and cannot as yet send out a number of
pings simultaneously.

In PHP 4.3.0 and after, this would be possible using the `stream_*()`
functions, in particular `stream_select()`, but given that I'm aiming for
compatibility with PHP 4.1, this isn't feasible as the sole mechanism. What I
may do is wrap the mechanism up in a factory that returns the appropriate
mechanism based on whether it's possible to use the `stream_*()` functions or
not.

The response parsing code should be more robust: it treats all non-2xx codes as
errors, does not understand line continuations, and probably doesn't have
enough error handling code.

Some services allow whatever is pinging them to specify a feed URI. This ought
to be something the user could enter, and possibly for BlogPing to check for.

If no blog title is provided, BlogPing ought to be able to guess it with by
GETting the URL provided.


Contacting

I don't give out my email address anymore due to spam, but I do have a contact
form on my website. You can email me from:

Don't worry if I don't get back immediately. I'll probably be too busy, but be
assured that I'll be feeling guilty about not mailing back. I'm not kidding!

History
-------

0.1 (Some time around the big snowstorm in Boston in February 2006)
: Initial version.

1.0 (2006-05-02)
: First public code release.

1.1 (2006-05-14)
: Removed some remaining IWPP code and assets. First SourceForge release.

1.5 (2007-11-11)
: New skin; ripped out AntiFwk completely, and pared back the basic HTTP
  client it contained to contain just enough code to POST an XML-RPC request
  to a responder. It's now pretty much standalone, except for some assets. I
  can't see this code being revised any further.

1.6 (2008-02-17)
: Filters out unknown POSTed services.
: `APP_VERSION` now includes hostname being used for pinging.
: Added back the old programmatic ping functionality, but the POSTed flag is
  now 'quiet' rather than 'silent' as it includes diagnostics now.

1.6.1 (2008-10-26)
: Removed 'Share Your OPML' and added 'blo.gs' to the default list.
: Fixed rendering of the application version.
: Some small improvements to the default layout, such as centring the form on
  the page, tiling the services checkboxes, wrapping them in a fieldset, and
  number of other minor ones.

1.7 (2008-11-29)
: Moved the responders list out of the code and into a separate file.
: Cleaned out some old-school code.
