                         A weblog aggregator ping proxy
                                by Keith Gaughan


Background
==========

While sitting in a Boston hotel room one weekend, filled to the gills with
some noxious disease I picked up either on the plane the weekend before or in
the office later that week, I found myself in need of something to do. Heading
out was out of the question, and American TV is, well, rubbish. It was a matter
of either doing something productive or going daft.

So I wrote a weblog ping proxy.


Usage
=====

The code's simple enough to edit. It's divided up into sections, and the bits
of most interest to you are the ones marked 'Configuration and Ping Responders'
and 'Page Template'. You edit the former to add and remove ping responders and
other settings, and the latter to reskin BlogPing to your own taste.


Technical Details
=================

You'll need PHP obviously. It works just fine on PHP 5 (which I have on my
laptop) and PHP 4 (which the server hosting the copy on my site runs). A quick
scan through the PHP manual lets me know that PHP 4.1 is the minimum you'll
need, though I'm only comfortable recommending a minimum of PHP 4.3.

It doesn't depend on any PECL modules or modules which might not be enabled
with your hosting provider such as cURL, so it should be deployable everywhere,
but you're out of luck if your hosting provider doesn't allow the opening of
sockets. It doesn't care about your magic quotes settings, but turn them off
anyway if you can 'cause it's a retarded misfeature.

The HTTP client code is pretty robust and designed to work with even the most
slow and petulant aggregators (*cough* PlanetPHP *cough*), but it doesn't
understand the chunked transfer encoding, so be warned. Also the code for
inspecting the response cheats somewhat. Rather than digging through the
document, we just look for 'flerror' and 'message' and extract the values
following them. Simple, but effective.


Contacting

I don't give out my email address anymore due to spam, but I do have a contact
form on my website. You can email me from:

Don't worry if I don't get back immediately. I'll probably be too busy, but be
assured that I'll be feeling guilty about not mailing back. I'm not kidding!

History
=======

0.1 (Some time around the big snowstorm in Boston in February 2006)
	Initial version.

1.0 (2006-05-02)
	First public code release.

1.1 (2006-05-14)
	Removed some remaining IWPP code and assets. First SourceForge release.

1.5 (2007-11-11)
	New skin; ripped out AntiFwk completely, and pared back the basic HTTP
	client it contained to contain just enough code to POST an XML-RPC
	request to a responder. It's now pretty much standalone, except for
	some assets. I can't see this code being revised any further.
